# My FlexGet Configuration

This is the author's working copy of a FlexGet configuration file.

On a user's system, it would be found int ~/.flexget/config.yml.

The aim of this configuration file is to automate the download and sorting of all of the owner's desired TV shows. It is a work in progress and is provided as a guide to others with no claim to brilliance nor assumption of accuracy.

The author uses the Deluge BitTorrent program on a headless Raspberry Pi Model B running as a daemon process.

The Pi connects via NFS to an exported TV Show directory 'Series' hosted on a Synology DS1812+

Shows and their seasons are structured as follows:

>  Modern Family
>    Season 1
>    Season 2
>    Season 3
>    Season 4
>    Season 5
>      Modern Family S05E01.avi
