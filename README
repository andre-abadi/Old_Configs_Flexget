This is the author's working copy of a FlexGet configuration file.

On a user's system, it would be found int ~/.flexget/config.yml.
Also known as /home/users_name/.flexget/config.yml.

The aim of this configuration file is to automate the download
and sorting of all of the author's desired TV shows. It is a work
in progress and is provided as a guide to others with no claim
to brilliance nor assumption of accuracy.

The author uses the Deluge BitTorrent program on a headless server
running as a daemon process. It feeds finished files into a RAID5
array in the series folder, shown as /md0/series/ above.

Shows and their seasons are structured as Show/Season N/*
